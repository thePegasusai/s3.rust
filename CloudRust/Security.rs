// Security: A production-ready S3 storage system would need to provide a way to secure data by implementing authentication, authorization and encryption mechanisms. This can be achieved by using libraries such as rust-aws-signature-v4, rust-jwt and ring.

    extern crate aws_signature_v4;
    extern crate base64;
    extern crate ring;
    extern crate time;

    use self::aws_signature_v4::{Credentials, Region};
    use self::ring::{digest, hmac};
    use self::time::{Duration, PreciseTime};

    struct S3Client {
        credentials: Credentials,
        region: Region,
    }

    impl S3Client {
        fn new(credentials: Credentials, region: Region) -> Self {
            S3Client { credentials, region }
        }

            request.headers_mut().insert(
                "X-Amz-Date",
                format!("{}T000000Z", PreciseTime::now().to_utc().
