//Scalability: A production-ready S3 storage system would need to be able to scale horizontally to handle large amounts of data and requests. This could be achieved by implementing a load balancer, sharding and partitioning data across multiple 

    struct LoadBalancer {
        servers: Vec<String>,

            // Send request to the corresponding server to retrieve the object
