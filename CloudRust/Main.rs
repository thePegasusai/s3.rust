// In this example, I've assumed the existence of modules bucket, object, error, and config that contain the functions for creating and deleting buckets, uploading and downloading objects, managing errors and reading configuration respectively.

This code is showing how to use these functions in the main function and handle the results/errors returned by these functions. This is just an example, you can use these functions in the way you want and handle the errors based on your use case.
