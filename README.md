Building our own s3 storage system in rust ( example) 

Building a fully functional and production-ready S3 storage system in Rust would be a complex and ambitious task, and it would likely require a significant amount of time and resources. However, I can show you some basic steps on how you could implement a simple and limited version of an S3 storage system in Rust.

Here are the basic steps you could take to build a simple S3 storage system in Rust:

Keep in mind that this is a very basic example of an S3 storage system and it lacks of many important features such as security, durability, scalability, and performance that an actual S3 storage system provides. It also lacks of many other S3 features such as versioning, life cycle, replica and many others.

A production ready version of an S3 storage system would require a much more complex and robust design and implementation. Additionally, it would require many other components such as a distributed file system, a load balancer and a database to handle metadata and acess control.
